To test, run test.py and it'll index all the *.txt files in source/

It's pretty basic, just a way for me to experiment with text indexing. I ported this to erlang/merle in the erlang branch but performance was less than desirable. All further development will be in Python/memcached

h2. Disclaimer

This is written for Python 3.0 and as such it has considerable differences from Python < 3.0.

h2. PS

Even though the IO in Python 3.0 is considerably slower, the data processing is significantly faster.
