The United States competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. American athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games since the 1896 Summer Olympics except the 1980 Summer Olympics, which the U.S. boycotted. The United States entered the Games as the most successful nation in Olympic history, winning 2,177 medals in total and 891 of them gold.[5] The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) sent 596 athletes to Beijing (310 men and 286 women), and competed in 27 out of 28 sports.[1][6] The U.S. did not qualify for either the men's or women's team handball tournament in Beijing.

The USOC selected San Jose State University in San Jose, California, as the primary processing center for all Team USA members headed for Beijing 2008.[7] Team USA members flew into San Jose via San Jose International Airport or San Francisco International Airport for at least two days of document checks, health examinations, cultural briefings, portrait sittings, uniform fittings, and last-minute workout sessions.[8]

The U.S. did not win the most gold medals for the first time in a Summer Games since 1992, losing the gold medal count to China (51-36).[9] However, the U.S. won its most medals ever (110) in a non-boycotted games, the total medal count, and more silver and bronze medals than any other participating country.[4][10] The Olympiad also marked the record 8 gold medal wins for American swimmer Michael Phelps, who surpassed American Mark Spitz's record of 7 golds in a single Games in 1972.[11] Phelps also surpassed Spitz, Larissa Latynina of the USSR, Paavo Nurmi of Finland, and American sprinter Carl Lewis to become the current record holder for the most Olympic gold medals (14).[12]

The United States also saw milestones in women's swimming. Natalie Coughlin won 6 medals in Beijing, the most for a female Olympic swimmer.[13] Dara Torres, who won 3 silver medals after an eight year absence from the Olympic Games, became the oldest Olympic swimmer to win a medal at the age of 41.[14] American Gymnast Nastia Liukin won the coveted Gold medal in Individual All-Around, becoming the third American woman to win the title.[15] It was also a successful Olympics for American team-based sports, as the United States men's and women's basketball teams both won gold, as did men's volleyball, men and women's beach volleyball, women's soccer, women's eight in rowing, and the men's and women's 4x400 meter relay teams.[16] Several other sports saw silver and bronze medals in women's volleyball, softball, baseball, men's team gymnastics, women's team gymnastics, men's fencing sabre team, women's fencing foil team, and both men's and women's water polo.

American archer Khatuna Lorig at the 2008 Olympic Games.

The United States men's archery team took sixth place at the 2007 World Outdoor Target Championships, earning the nation a full complement of three qualification spots for the Olympic men's competitions. The women's team finished in eleventh place, not qualifying the team. Jennifer Nichols earned a spot via individual qualification in that tournament.[18] Karen Scavotto earned the United States another women's spot by finishing second in the Pan American championship.[19]

The United States announced its Olympic team on May 5, 2008, following a national selection tournament.[20] The women's roster included 2004 Olympian Jennifer Nichols and three-time Olympian Khatuna Lorig, who previously represented the Unified Team at the 1992 Olympics and Georgia at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000.[21] On the men's side, first-time Olympian Brady Ellison joined four-time Olympian Butch Johnson and two-time Olympian Vic Wunderle.

    Main article: Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics

The 2008 U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials were held in Eugene, Oregon, at the University of Oregon's Hayward Field from June 27 through July 6, 2008.[22] Hayward Field had previously hosted the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1972, 1976 and 1980.

    * Note:Competitors in athletics events could qualify for the next round of competition in two ways. Qualifying by right was posting a high result in their own heat, and qualifying by result was posting a high result in overall standings. Ranks shown are thus those within each heat, not in overall standings.

The United States was represented in four out of the five badminton events: men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles and women's doubles. The U.S. had qualified a mixed doubles team, but the Badminton World Federation rescinded the slot.[62] No American has ever medaled in badminton since it became an Olympic sport in 1992, although Howard Bach and Bob Malaythong became the first Americans to reach the quarter-finals.[63]

Kobe Bryant leaps over a member of Team China at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The United States earned qualification spots for both men's and women's basketball by winning the FIBA Americas Championship 2007 and the FIBA Americas Championship for Women 2007.[73] It was the sixteenth appearance of the nation in the men's tournament and the eighth in the women's tournament; the United States missed only the boycotted 1980 Games for each.[74] The 12-player roster for the USA Men's Basketball Senior National Team was announced on June 23, 2008.[73] The first nine members of the eventual 12-player 2008 U.S. Women's Olympic Basketball Team were announced on May 31, 2008.[75] The final three members were named on July 10, 2008.[76]

The women's team successfully defended their 2004 Olympic championship, defeating Australia in the gold medal game for the third consecutive Olympics. The victory allowed Lisa Leslie to join former teammate Teresa Edwards as the only basketball players to win four Olympic gold medals.[77] After a disappointing third-place finish in Athens, the men's team adopted the name "Redeem Team."[78] In the gold medal match, they beat 2006 FIBA World Champion Spain to give the U.S. its first gold medal in men's international competition in eight years.[79]

[edit] Boxing

    Main articles: Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics and Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Qualification

The United States qualified nine boxers for the Olympic boxing tournament. Five boxers (Yanez, Warren, Russell, Williams and Andrade) earned their spots at the 2007 World Championships.[80] Ali, Molina and Wilder qualified at the first American qualifying tournament.[81] Estrada was the last American boxer to qualify, doing so at the second American tournament.[82] The United States did not qualify in light heavyweight or super heavyweight classes.

The U.S. Boxing Team suffered several early setbacks from which it never recovered. Before they arrived in Beijing, U.S. boxers were reportedly unhappy with training methods, coaching, and travel restrictions.[83] On August 8, 2008, two-time national champion and bantamweight boxer Gary Russell Jr. was forced to withdraw from the Olympics after collapsing before his weigh-in.[84] Under International Amateur Boxing Federation rules, the U.S. was not permitted to select another boxer to take his place. Reigning flyweight world champion Raushee Warren, America's best hope for gold, lost his opening bout to Lee Ok-Sung of South Korea.[85] In the end, the U.S. left Beijing with one bronze won by Deontay Wilder, its worst performance in Olympic history.[86] The U.S. had previously won a single silver in 1948 and no medals in 1908 and 1980, when it did not send a boxing team. On September 5, 2008, the national director of coaching for USA Boxing, Dan Campbell, stepped down.[83]

    Main articles: Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics and Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Qualification

On July 15, 2008, the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) named the rider/horse combinations for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team.[95] All equestrian events were open in the Olympics, meaning men and women competed together. The Three events held in the Olympics for equestrian were: eventing, show jumping and dressage. The horses were shipped to England on July 17, placed under quarantine on July 22, 2008, and shipped to Hong Kong for the Olympic Games on July 30, 2008.[95] Before the start of the games, Heidi White-Carty and her horse Northern Spy withdrew from the U.S. eventing team because of a veterinary issue. Alternate Karen O'Connor and her horse Mandiba took their place on the team.[96]

The U.S. successfully defended its 2004 gold medal in the team jumping competition, defeating Canada in a timed jumpoff.[97]

On September 22, 2008, the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) disqualified the U.S. fourth-place finish in the Olympic team dressage event and Courtney King's thirteenth-place finish in individual dressage after King's horse Harmony's Mythilus tested positive for the banned substance felbinac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.[98] According to USA Today, the FEI did not believe King or "anyone on her behalf or related to the USEF had knowingly administered the medication to the horse."[98]

The 2008 United States Olympic Fencing Team was announced on June 11, 2008.[104] After the 1904 Olympics, the United States did not win an Olympic fencing gold medal until 2004.[105] But on the first full day of Olympic competition, Mariel Zagunis, Sada Jacobson and Becca Ward swept the fencing event in women's individual saber; it was the first American sweep of an Olympic fencing event since 1904. The U.S. left Beijing with a total of six medals.[9]

The United States earned spots in Beijing for both men's and women's soccer by advancing to the finals of the CONCACAF Pre-Olympic Tournaments in March and April 2008.[107][108] For the Olympic tournament, the full women's national team and the men's Under-23 team (augmented with three players over the age of 23) participated.[109] The 18-player roster for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Women's Soccer Team was announced on June 23, 2008.[110] In the final match before the Olympics on July 16, the women's team lost leading scorer Abby Wambach after she broke her left leg in a collision with Brazilian defender Andréia Rosa.[111] Lauren Cheney, originally selected as an alternate, replaced Wambach on the roster.[112] The 18-player roster for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Men's Soccer Team was announced on July 17, 2008.[113] After aggravating a hamstring injury, defender Nathan Sturgis was replaced by midfielder Dax McCarty on the Olympic roster July 24, 2008.[114]

Despite playing without Wambach and an early first-round loss to Norway, the women's soccer team successfully defended their 2004 gold medal by defeating Brazil in overtime; it was the third gold medal overall for the United States in women’s soccer.[115] The team had lost its previous match against Brazil 4-0 in the semifinals of the 2007 Women's World Cup.

[edit] Artistic gymnastics

The United States qualified a full complement of six men and six women in artistic gymnastics. Two members of the U.S. men's gymnastics team, Paul Hamm and Jonathan Horton, were named at the conclusion of the Olympic Trials. The rest of the team was announced on Sunday, June 22. Because of the injury of his hand and shoulder, Paul Hamm[116] withdrew from the Olympic team on July 28, 2008 and was replaced with alternate Raj Bhavsar. Additionally, Morgan Hamm withdrew from competition on August 7 because of an ankle injury, being replaced by Alexander Artemev.[117]

Two members of the U.S. women's gymnastics team, Shawn Johnson and Nastia Liukin, were named at the conclusion of the Olympics Trials on June 22. The rest of the women's team was not named at the Trials, although Chellsie Memmel, Samantha Peszek and Alicia Sacramone were projected to be the on the team. This left one spot vacant. The complete team was not announced until the conclusion of the women's selection camp at the Karolyi Camp near Houston, Texas, on July 17.[118]

[edit] Rhythmic gymnastics

The United States did not qualify to participate in any rhythmic gymnastic events because they did not place within the top 20 at the 2007 World Championships.[121] It was the second time the U.S. did not have a participant time since 1984, when rhythmic gymnastics became an Olympic sport.[122]
[edit] Trampoline

Two trampolinists competed for the United States in Beijing. Chris Estrada was the first male to represent the United States in trampoline, and it was also the first time the United States had representatives in both men's and women's events.[123][124] The U.S. has yet to have an athlete advance past the qualification stage.

[edit] Modern pentathlon

    Main article: Modern pentathlon at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Sheila Taormina, Margaux Isaksen and Eli Bremer were nominated to the pentathlon team after the U.S. was allocated three invitations by the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM), modern pentathlon's world governing body.[128] On the second allocation, both Sam Sacksen and Dennis Bowsher were offered bids by the UIPM.[129] Since one man was already on the squad, only one other slot was available. The U.S. used World Cup rankings to determine who would be on the squad and who would be named alternate. Bowsher appealed the decision but his claim was denied.[130]

On the men's team, U.S. Olympic Training Center residents Eli Bremer and Sam Sacksen both made their Olympic modern pentathlon debuts. They struggled early, with disappointing scores in shooting (10m air pistol) and fencing (Épée one touch).[131] For the women's team, 16-year-old Margaux Isaksen joined Sheila Taormina, the first woman to appear in the Olympics in three different sports.[131] Like the men, Isaksen and Toarmina started off slowly, failing to rank higher than 24th in either shooting or fencing. Toarmina, however, finished strongly, taking first place in riding (show jumping) and setting a Modern Pentathlon Olympic Record in swimming (200m freestyle).[132] The U.S. did not medal in modern pentathlon.

    Main article: Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics

The team roster for USA Softball was released on March 28, 2008.[140] It included a fifteen-person team roster and a replacement roster of three players. The United States brought an impressive softball record to Beijing, winning every Olympic and world title since 1982.[141] Prior to Beijing, it had a record of 106-10 in World Championships and 32-4 in the Olympics.[141][142] It had won all three Olympic gold medals in softball, and outscored opponents 51-1 in Athens. American dominance may have contributed to the IOC's decision to remove the sport from the Olympics in 2005.[143]

But at the Beijing Olympics, the United States lost to Japan 3-1 in the gold medal game. Japanese pitcher Yukiko Ueno had an outstanding performance after pitching 21 innings the day before.[144] Following the surprise loss, the top three teams spelled "2016" using softballs in front of home plate in the hopes of Olympic reinstatement.[145]

From left to right: Ryan Lochte (bronze), Michael Phelps (gold) and László Cseh (silver) show off the medals they earned from the men's 400 metre individual medley.

    Main article: Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics

The United States Olympic Team Trials in Swimming were held on June 29 – July 6 in Omaha, Nebraska.[146] The U.S. sent two people in each individual discipline and up to six people for the 4x100 freestyle relays and 4x200 freestyle relays.[147] On August 1, Jessica Hardy, who had qualified in the 100 meter breaststroke and the 50 meter freestyle, withdrew from the Olympic team after failing an anti-doping test at the national trials. Hardy opted to pull out rather than contesting the test results at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[148]

The United States left Beijing with 31 swimming medals: 12 gold, 9 silver and 10 bronze.[149] This surpassed the 28 medals won by the swim team in Athens.[9] In the process, the U.S. broke ten swimming world records and twenty-four American records.[150] The American performance in swimming was highlighted by Michael Phelps, who won a total of eight gold medals, surpassing Mark Spitz's 36-year old single Games record of seven gold medals.[151] Phelps also surpassed Spitz, Larissa Latynina of the USSR, Paavo Nurmi of Finland, and American sprinter Carl Lewis to become the current record holder for the most Olympic gold medals (fourteen).[12] All three men's relay teams set world records, and an additional six individual world records were set by Phelps, Ryan Lochte and Aaron Peirsol.

The United States also saw milestones in women's swimming. Natalie Coughlin won six medals, more than any other female swimmer in Beijing.[13] The six medals was also the most for any American female athlete in a single Olympics. Rebecca Soni set a world record in the 200 meter breaststroke. Dara Torres, who won 3 silver medals after an eight year absence from the Olympic Games, became the oldest Olympic swimmer to win a medal at the age of 41.[14]

    * Qualifiers for the latter rounds of swimming events were decided on a time only basis, therefore positions shown are overall results versus competitors in all heats.

[edit] Synchronized swimming

    Main article: Synchronized swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics

One of the first sports in which the U.S. qualified for Beijing and formalized its Olympic roster was synchronized swimming. Berths in the duet and team events were secured at the 2007 Pan American Games.[152][153] After winning both duet and team bronze medals in Athens, the U.S. failed to win a medal for the second time since synchronized swimming became an Olympic sport in 1984.[154]

The United States qualified for the women's team competition, 3 places in women's singles, and 1 place in men's singles. Gao Jun and Wang Chen automatically qualified in women's singles by being in the top 20 International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) world rankings.[155] Yao "Crystal" Huang took the third and final North American women's spot by winning at the North American Trials in Vancouver, qualifying an American women's team in the process. David Zhuang secured the only American spot in men's singles at the North American Trials.

With the exception of alternate Jackie Lee, the entire American team was composed of Chinese-born athletes.[156] This included Gao Jun, who won a silver medal in doubles for China at the 1992 Olympics and was competing as an American for the third time.[157] Although she failed to obtain a medal, Wang Chen became the first American player to advance to the quarter-finals in Olympic table tennis history after defeating 2004 Olympic bronze medalist Kim Kyung-Ah.[158] The fifth place performance by the women's team was also the best finish the U.S. has ever had.[157]

The United States sent the maximum of four athletes to compete in Olympic Taekwondo; the team was announced after the final phase of the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials for Taekwondo on April 5, 2008.[159][160] Diana, Mark and Steven Lopez became the first trio from the same family to compete for the United States since 1904.[161] All three of them won medals: one silver and two bronze. Steven Lopez, a defending two-time Olympic gold medalist, lost his only match in six years after a controversial point deduction in the quarterfinals.[162][163]

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) formally announced their Olympic team for tennis on June 26, 2008.[164] Because of a nagging knee injury, Lindsay Davenport withdrew from the women's singles competition on August 8, 2008, although she still played in women's doubles.[84] In a last-minute decision, Jill Craybas was selected to participate in her first Olympics at age 34.[165]

After losing all eight previous matches against Roger Federer, James Blake defeated him in a surprise upset in the quarterfinals of men's singles.[166] But Federer went on to beat the top-ranked American twins Bob and Mike Bryan in the doubles semifinals.[167] Blake finished in fourth place after losing the bronze medal match to Novak Djokovic, while the Bryan twins won a bronze medal by defeating Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra. Venus Williams, 2008 Wimbledon champion, and her sister Serena were both upset in the quarterfinals of women's singles.[168] However, they went on to win the gold in doubles over Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual, and improving the sisters' Olympic record to 10-0.[169]

The USA Weightlifting trials were held on May 25 in Atlanta, Georgia. The initial team included seven competitors and two alternates.[181] Casey Burgener was originally selected to lift at the +105kg event after the USOC reported that the International Weightlifting Federation offered the United States a third men’s Olympic slot.[182] The third slot never materialized, and the United States was not placed on the start list for the +105 event.[183][184] The best U.S. hope for a weightlifting medal was expected to be Melanie Roach, who set a new American record and finished in sixth place.[185]
