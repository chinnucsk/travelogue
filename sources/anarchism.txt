Anarchism is a political philosophy encompassing theories and attitudes which support the elimination of all forms of compulsory government.[1][2] Specific anarchists may have additional criteria for what constitutes anarchism, and they often disagree with each other on what these criteria are. According to The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, "there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance."[3]

There are many types and traditions of anarchism, some of which are not mutually exclusive.[4][5][6] Anarchism is usually considered to be a radical left-wing ideology,[7] and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism or participatory economics; however, anarchism has always included an individualist strain,[7][8] including those who support capitalism (for example anarcho-capitalists, agorists, and other free-market anarchists) or similar market-oriented economic structures; for example, mutualists.[9][10][11] Others, such as panarchists and anarchists without adjectives, neither advocate nor object to any particular form of organization as long as it is not compulsory. Some anarchist schools of thought differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.[2] Some anarchists fundamentally oppose all forms of coercion, while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution and terrorism, on the path to anarchy.[12]

The term anarchism derives from the Greek ἀναρχος, anarchos, meaning "without rulers",[13][14] from the prefix ἀν- (an-, "without") + ἄρχή (archê, "sovereignty, realm, magistracy")[15] + -ισμός (-ismos, from a stem -ιζειν, -izein). Since the nineteenth century, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism.[16]

Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of Taoist sages Laozi[17] and Zhuangzi. The latter has been translated, "There has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success]," and "A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a State."[18] Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics, and their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics.[17][19]

Modern anarchism, however, sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.[20] Although by the turn of the 19th century the term "anarchist" had an entirely positive connotation,[21] it first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists to damn those who were fomenting disorder.[21] By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the Enragés, began to use the term positively,[22][unreliable source?] in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as oxymoronic.[21] From this climate William Godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought.[23] Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work."[17][24] Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present "necessary evil"[25] that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.[23] Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.[26] Godwin felt discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable.

The first to describe himself as an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon,[21] which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.[27] Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organization emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does “what he wishes and only what he wishes"[28] and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."[29] Like Godwin, Proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action. He saw anarchy as "a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune."[30] By "commune", Proudhon meant local self-government or according to literal translation, "municipality", rather than a communist arrangement.[31]

Mutualism

Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labor movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.[32] Proudhon's ideas were introduced by Charles A. Dana,[33] to individualist anarchists in the United States including Benjamin Tucker and William Batchelder Greene.[34]

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to Greene, in the mutualist system each worker would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount."[35] Mutualism has been retrospectively characterized as being ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.[36] Proudhon first characterized his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."[37]

Individualist anarchism

    Main article: Individualist anarchism

Individualist anarchism comprises several traditions[38] which hold that "individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority."[39] Individualist anarchism is supportive of property being held privately, unlike the social/socialist/collectivist/communitarian wing which advocates common ownership.[40] Individualist anarchism has been espoused by individuals such as William Godwin,[41] Henry David Thoreau,[42] Josiah Warren, and Murray Rothbard.

[edit] Egoist anarchism
19th century philosopher Max Stirner, a prominent early individualist anarchist (sketch by Friedrich Engels).

One of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism was Max Stirner,[43] who wrote The Ego and Its Own (1844), a founding text of the philosophy.[43] Stirner's philosophy was an "egoist" form of individualist anarchism according to which the only limitation on the rights of the individual is his power to obtain what he desires,[44] taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.[45] To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality" – he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.[46] Stirner preached self-assertion and foresaw "associations of egoists" where respect for ruthlessness drew people together.[41]

In Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.[47] They rejected organizing, believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism.[48] This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcho-feminist Emma Goldman.[47]

Though Stirner's egoism is individualist, it has also influenced some anarcho-communists.[49] Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are strongly Egoist in nature.[50]
